# JUCE Audio Plugin Template

This repository is a template for creating an audio plugin using the JUCE framework without the need for Projucer.

This includes a GitHub Action for building - currently, this builds VST3, AU and Standalone for macOS.

Support for Windows and Linux are provided theoretically, and have not been reviewed or tested.
